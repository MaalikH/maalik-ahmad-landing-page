Hey, welcome to the blog.

I created this space so friends, family, and anyone curious can get a look into my world. What I'm building, what I'm learning, and what's coming next. It won't always be tech, but it'll be tech-focused most of the time. I've found it hard to keep everyone updated individually, so this is the spot. If you want to know what I've been up to, you'll find it here.

Think of it like a letter. We're bringing letters back.

Alright, let's get into it.

This month wasn't just about working on apps.
It was about working in a new way.

I've been using AI tools throughout all of 2025, but something really shifted around August. The tools got sharper, the workflows clicked, and by January the way I build software had fundamentally changed. The gap between having an idea and having a working tool is getting smaller, and I'm right in the middle of that change.

Instead of just writing code line by line like before, I now work alongside an AI assistant called Claude Code. It doesn't replace me. It works more like a very fast, very capable assistant. I still decide what to build and how it should work. The AI helps with the heavy lifting: writing parts of the code, fixing issues, organizing systems, and helping me move from idea to working feature much faster.

Before that shift, building meant constantly jumping between Google searches, documentation, and forums trying to figure things out one piece at a time. Now it feels more like a conversation:

> "Here's what I want to build."
> "Okay, let's design it."
> "Now let's implement it."

That shift defined my January.

## What I Was Building This Month

I spent most of the month inside three main apps.

### 1. Daily Briefing, A Tool for My Own Life

This is a personal dashboard that pulls together everything I need in one place each morning:

- Calendar
- Reminders
- Habits
- Project timelines
- News
- YouTube and podcasts

Instead of checking five different apps, I get one organized view.

What's important isn't just what it does. It's how fast it came together. Connecting all those systems, especially Apple services like Calendar and Reminders, normally takes a lot of setup and troubleshooting. With AI helping write code, connect pieces, and design the structure, I was able to build this in a couple of weekends.
Ironically, the biggest challenge this month was managing multiple projects… so I built a tool to help me manage building tools.

### 2. Nudge, From Almost Done to Deploy-Ready

Nudge is an app that sends scheduled motivational and affirmation notifications to help with mindset and productivity.

Going into January, Nudge was about 70% done. The core functionality was already in place. Notifications worked, the main screens were built, and the idea was solid. What it needed was polish: cleaning up rough edges, tightening the experience, and getting everything production-ready for the App Store.

This month I:

- Redesigned the onboarding (the first time user experience)
- Cleaned up messy code
- Set up the production environment needed for App Store submission

It went from "almost there" to "ready for the real world." The goal now is pushing it across the finish line.

### 3. Black Is History, A Personal Project

This one means a lot to me.
Black Is History is an educational app focused on Black historical figures and stories. It's designed to be a free, interactive learning tool where people can also suggest figures to include.

In January I:

- Generated content for historical figures (including images)
- Improved the mobile experience
- Prepared it for its first deployment

After two months of development, it's set to launch in February for Black History Month.

## The Biggest Change Wasn't the Apps. It Was My Role

AI has changed how I think about building.

Before, a lot of energy went into the mechanics of coding every single part. Now, the barrier between idea and working system is lower. Setup is faster. Planning is easier. If something gets tedious or complicated, AI helps push through the blocker.

I feel less like someone typing code all day and more like a director:

- Deciding what should be built
- Designing how systems connect
- Guiding the process

I still need to understand everything. I still review and adjust what AI produces. But I'm spending more time thinking strategically and less time stuck on small technical hurdles.

Projects that might have stalled in the past are moving again.

## The Hard Part

The biggest challenge wasn't technical. It was time and attention. Managing multiple projects at once gets complex fast. That's actually why I leaned into Daily Briefing: I needed better organization just to keep up with my own workflow.

The lesson this month: AI can help build features, but I still have to design the system and manage the direction.

## What's Next

February is about bringing things out into the world:

- Black Is History launching for Black History Month
- Nudge moving toward App Store submission
- Possibly starting a new project called Black in Biz

Longer term: more apps, more free tools on the web, and even some merchandise ideas.

## Final Thought

AI isn't replacing me.
It's upgrading how I work.

January was about learning how to build in this new way. Faster, more ambitious, and more systems-focused. February is where more of that work becomes visible.

See you at the end of next month.
