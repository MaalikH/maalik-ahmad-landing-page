        description:
          "I’m a creator at heart—driven by vision, guided by execution. I don’t believe in staying in one lane. Whether I’m developing software or designing garments, I use my understanding of technology, design, and culture to bring ideas to life. For me, it’s never been about limiting myself to one medium—it’s about creating things that didn’t exist before and making them real.\n\nWith over seven years of experience, I’ve built modern, scalable web and mobile applications using Angular, React, Next.js, Swift, and Ionic. I’ve led and contributed to high-impact projects for enterprise clients like IHG and Veteran Affairs. Along the way, I’ve also sharpened my design sensibilities—working fluently in Figma and Adobe Creative Suite, creating wireframes when needed or turning visual concepts into fully functional products. I’m just as comfortable designing the front of the house as I am building the back.\n\nMy creative drive started early. I was first introduced to vinyl and heat pressing as a teenager, and that hands-on introduction to customization sparked something lasting. Since then, I’ve gone from pressing t-shirts to designing full collections—producing in-house when it makes sense and outsourcing when scale demands it. My clothing is inspired by culture and built with intention. Each drop tells a story, and I’ll continue to explore the edges of what's possible through fashion, tech, and the spaces in between.",
